Install/Uninstall instruction for the GLFusion classifieds plugin.

The Classifieds plugin supports the automatic plugin upload and installation
offered by glFusion 1.1.2 and later.  This is the recommended method.

If you are unable to use the automatic method, the manual method is still
supported.


MANUAL INSTALLATION

Step 1:  Back up your GLFusion Database.  The classifieds plugin adds tables 
to your GLFusion database. You can do this with the built in admin backup 
facility.

Step 2:  Uncompress the classifieds plugin archive while in the 
<private_dir>/plugins directory.  The archive will create a 
directory called classifieds in the plugins directory.

Step 3:  Create the public_html and admin directories.  Under your html 
directory (usually public_html) create a directory called classifieds.  
Under your admin/plugins/ directory create a directory called classifieds.

Step 4:  Change to your <private_dir>/plugins/classifieds/ directory.
Copy the files in the admin directory to the admin/plugins/classifieds/ 
directory your created in step 3.  Copy the files and directories in the 
public_html directory to the public_html/classifieds/ directory you created 
in step 3.

Change permission on images directory:

    chmod -R 777 images

Step 5:  Log in to your GLFusion as a root user, chose Plugins from Admin 
Block. You will see the new plugin awaiting installation. Click Install. 
The install page will tell you if the install was successful or not.  If not 
examine GLFusion system error log for possible problems.

The classifieds plugin should now be installed and functioning.  Clicking on 
the classifieds Icon will take you to the admin page where you can add your 
own categories and subcategories.  Visit the site Configuration section to 
set system options for the Classifieds plugin.


UPGRADING (Manual):

Perform the same steps as for a new installation.  The static configuration 
items have been moved from config.php to classifieds.php; config.php is no 
longer necessary unless you have customized your settings.  If you have no 
custom configuration items, remove the config.php file.

You should clear the template cache after performing the update since the 
template files may have changed.

You should also visit the site configuration area and check the configuration 
for the Classifieds plugin.  Even if you make no changes, click "Save" to push 
any new configuration items into the cache.


REMOVAL:

Step 1:  Go to Admin Block/Plugins. Find the plugin in the list of plugins, 
click the number. Then press Delete, confirm (or not) deletion, this will 
remove all the plugin data from your database.

Step 2:  Delete the three plugin directories created in the install process:  
    <private_dir>plugins/classifieds/
    <public_html>/classifieds/
    <public_html>/admin/plugins/classifieds/

Thats it.
