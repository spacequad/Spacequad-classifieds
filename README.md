Adapted for GLFusion 1.0 with additional modifications by:

******************************************
*   Changes from the zScripts version
******************************************

Several key changes have been made to this version:

-   All configuration, except table names and a few non-user-modifiable items,
    is handled through GLFusion's central configuration system.

-   Thumbnails are always automatically generated.  Images are always resized
    and are displayed using Slimbox.

-   There are no "custom fields".  A "Price" field has been added.

-   Both "For Sale" and "Wanted" ads are supported.  There's no difference
    other than which is displayed with the ad.

-   Search is handled by GLFusion's search function.  A "keywords" field has
    been added which is used along with the subject and description when
    searching, but is not displayed with the ad.

... and a variety of obvious visual changes.

Check the CHANGELOG file for changes since the original glFusion release.
